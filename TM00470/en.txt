Bestowing the Splendour of Great Bliss A Brief Fulfilment Offering for the Padma Ḍākinī
Namo guru padma-ḍākinyai!
Hūṃ hrīḥ. From the magnetizing palace of great bliss,
In the heart of a red semi-circle, ablaze with light,
Is the lady who magnetizes, Padma Ḍākinī,
Together with hosts of magnetizing ḍākinīs
From Vajra, Ratna, Padma and Karma families,
Millions of emanations and further emanations.
Together with your retinues, approach now,
And take your seats of sun, moon and lotus.
Clouds of delightful offerings,
Bounties of existence and quiescence,
All riches, whatsoever they may be,
Arise as Samantabhadra’s offering clouds,
Multiplied through the play of immaculate samādhi,
And fill the entire expanse of the dharmadhātu.
May those in the maṇḍala of the Padma Ḍākinī
Accept them all by means of their six vajra faculties.
May this bring delight and fulfil solemn commitments.
Before the hosts of ḍākinīs, we confess our impairments and breakages.
Bring environment and inhabitants, appearances and mind, under control.
Increase the power of subtle channels, wind-energies and essences.
Gather pristine wisdom within the space of the central channel.
In the great bliss and utter purity of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
Grant us the attainment of magnetizing power
And help us to obtain the kāya of the Lotus Ḍākinī!
