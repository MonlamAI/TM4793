Verses for Accumulating the Tsok Offering to the Great Compassionate One
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
To the root and lineage gurus, victorious ones and their heirs,
Hosts of yidam deities, ḍākinīs, dharmapālas and wealth deities,
And especially the deities of the Great Compassionate One,
I present this sublime feast offering of sensory pleasures.
Please accept it, and pacify all obstacles and adversity,
Cause authentic twofold bodhicitta to dawn within our minds,
And inspire us to perfect the accumulations, traverse the paths and stages,
And take rebirth within the land of Great Bliss.
oṃ guru maṇḍala deva gaṇa ḍākinī dharmapāla saparivāra gaṇacakra pūja hoḥ
