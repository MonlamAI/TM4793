Consecration of Scattering Grain
oṃ ye dharmā hetu prabhāvā hetuṃ teṣāṃ tathāgato hyavadat | teṣāṃ ca yo nirodha evaṃ vādī mahāśramaṇaḥ svāhā ||
Upon a moon-disc at the heart of the Lord of Sages and his retinue is the revolving mantra-garland of the Essence of Dependent Origination dhāraṇī, from which rays of light shoot out.
They gather the blessings of the knowledge, love and capacity of the Victorious Ones and their heirs, which then dissolve back into the mantra-garland at their heart-centres.
Further rays of light beyond imagining then pacify all flaws in dependent origination throughout the environment and among its inhabitants,
And cause longevity, merit, wisdom and qualities to increase.
The rays of light from the mantra then form a protective dome into which I and others—all who require protection—are admitted.
oṃ ye dharmā hetu prabhāvā hetuṃ teṣāṃ tathāgato hyavadat | teṣāṃ ca yo nirodha evaṃ vādī mahāśramaṇaḥ svāhā ||
