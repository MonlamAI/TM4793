Truthful Words to Bring Immortality A Prayer for the Long Life of Choktrul Rinpoche, Emanation of the Great Treasure-Revealing Guru
Oá¹ƒ svasti.
Single embodiment of the body, speech, mind, qualities and activity
Of Chokgyur Lingpa, representative of Padma,
Supreme guru, the very embodiment of the changeless vajra,
I pray that you may live and turn the Dharma Wheel for a hundred aeons.
You who cause the sun-like general teachings of the Victorious One
And the luminous essence of the definitively secret Vajra Vehicle
To flourish supremely through explanation and through practice,
Glorious guru, may your lotus feet remain forever secure.
For me, from now until I reach the essence of awakening,
May I never be apart from the glorious guru,
Eternal lotus-holder, great embodiment of all buddha families,
And may our wishes and the twofold benefit be spontaneously accomplished.
