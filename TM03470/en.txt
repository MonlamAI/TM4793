The Ḍākinī’s Melody A Feast Song
Ahoye!
From billowing white clouds and wondrous rainbow light,
Lake-born Vajra, together with your hosts of vīras and ḍākinīs,
Let the white flower petals of blessings and auspiciousness
Grant me, I pray, the attainment of immortality, here and now!
With the playful dances and vajra songs of vīras and ḍākinīs,
Reaching the pinnacle of the great wisdom of fourfold joy,
This wisdom that is co-emergent and so utterly pure—aho!
How wondrous the dawn of apparent existence as the maṇḍala!
The pleasures of the gaṇacakara of sixfold satisfaction, 1
The nectar of immortality arisen from unattached enjoyment,
And the youthfulness of Padmākara, the master of yoga—
Grant us the celebration of actual attainment within this very life!
Ahoye!
In the unexcelled realm of Dhumathala in Oḍḍiyāna
Are the masses of vidyādharas, vīras and ḍākinīs—aho!
Within the citadel of the vajra aggregates and three seats
Is the display of an infinite ocean of Three Roots—wonder!
In Lotus Light on Glorious Mountain in the heart’s dark agate,
The Mahāguru displays his dazzling smile of radiant delight.
As I present the offering-cloud of non-dual bliss and emptiness,
Grant me, right now, the supreme attainment of the great secret!
The wondrous gathering of the gaṇacakra is delightful:
Celebrating the divine feast of the yogins and yoginīs
Stirs clouds of the immaculate nectar of bliss-emptiness,
A symphony of apparent existence as vajra bliss supreme.
