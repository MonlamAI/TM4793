Prayer for the Long Life of Katok Situ Orgyen Chökyi Nyima 1
Oṃ svasti!
With the resplendence of a sun of virtue and excellence,
You bestow the supreme light of abundant fortune,
Guru, Three Jewels and ocean-like Three Roots,
Cause these pure aspirations to be swiftly fulfilled.
Powerful adept, peerless in maintaining the traditions
Of kama and terma, the teachings of the Guru of Oḍḍiyāna,
Great Maitreya, the fifth conqueror, transported to this world,
May you abide for a hundred aeons with unchanging vitality.
With the Dharma Sun of the teaching and practice of the Sage’s teachings,
Both sūtra and mantra, lighting up the world in every direction,
And activity based on learning, ethics and kindness spreading all around,
May you abide within the essential nature of boundless qualities.
As your lotus feet remain forever firm upon the vajra throne,
May you triumph in the battle with obstacles and demonic forces.
And may you attain the sublime status of a king of Dharma,
Who spontaneously accomplishes the twofold benefit.
Through the blessings of praying in this way,
May the teachings and their holders flourish,
And, with all the ills of this evil age pacified,
May the light of auspicious goodness dawn.
