My failed knowing, grasping brings downfalls—

Hundred thousand form, speech, mind sworn oaths,
My own failed oaths and my words not kept,

Sattva . Since past failings have become defects,
Vajra Dakini, my karma’s guard,
Can cause me very great pain, trouble:

Focus-free, not failing to reveal,
All Good, all perfect, aware expanse,
Not joined, not parted, space expanse: Āḥ
