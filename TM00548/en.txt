Prayer for the Long Life of Kalzang Drolkar
Oṃ svasti!
Through the great power of truth and the compassionate blessings
Of the immortal vidyādharas and the ocean-like Three Roots,
May any obstacles to the life of this queen of adepts be dispelled,
And may her lotus feet remain forever firm in indestructible vajra longevity.
With the increased rejuvenation of fortunate accomplishment
And empowered by the nectar that flows from the excellent vase
Of White Tārā, Wish-Fulfilling Wheel,
May you abide as the essence of the Queen of Siddhas,
And grant all that is desired to benefit both teachings and beings.
