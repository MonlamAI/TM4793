The Descent of Wisdom Blessings A Feast Song
Ahoye!
Residing in the utterly pure expanse of rainbow light above
Is father Padmasambhava, embodiment of all Three Roots,
Surrounded by a retinue of vidyādharas, vīras and ḍākinīs.
Reveal to this child of yours your radiant and joyous smile.
Great treasury of boundless knowledge, love and capacity,
You are the one in whom I place all my hope and trust,
For your paternal compassion could never let me down.
The excellent occasion is the great festival of the tenth day,
When the ḍākinīs of the sacred places and locality gather.
And in the midst of this immeasurably vast assembly,
I, an aimless, carefree child of awareness, am content.
The delights of the feast fill the sky like billowing clouds,
And with vajra faculties the deities savour every pleasure,
Thereby igniting fourfold joy and immaculate great bliss.
Sounds are a vowel and consonant gift—audible, empty.
Form is the dazzling display of the hundred modes of dance,
Mind is a-haṃ , blazing, dripping, empty-bliss intoxication,
Which causes the assembled deities of the four chakras to dance.
Inspire perception of bodily skandhas, elements and sources as deities,
Cause speech and respiration to dissolve within the central channel,
And let mind and mental states enter the sphere of great luminosity.
Within the fundamental pureland, the realm of the great Lotus Net,
May I encounter Tsokye Dorje, the three kāyas of my own awareness,
And may the six classes of mother-beings be freed from saṃsāra’s depths.
